# To-Do App

![Project Image](/images/TODO-PROJ.jpg)

## Description

This is a simple To-Do List App built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (preprocessed with PostCSS). The app stores your tasks in the local storage, so you won't lose them when refreshing or closing the page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your machine:

1. [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/)
3. [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) (or any local development server of your choice)

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LRSORRENTI/To-Do-List.git

```

**Navigate into the directory:**

```
cd To-Do-List
```

**Install the dependencies:**

```
npm install
```

**Run Gulp to process and build your CSS:**

```
gulp
```

This will create a dist folder in your directory, with your processed .postcss file converted to a .css file.

**Running the App:**

To see the app in action, use Live Server to serve your index.html file. If you have Live Server installed globally, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```
live-server
```

This will open a new browser window/tab with your app running.
